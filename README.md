Our project is a service for tracking medical records and other information
for patients, doctors, and medical providers. You can sign in to our app
on the landing page as a patient, doctor, insurance company, or medical facility.

In order to run our app:

1. Download the custom_db_credential.py and include it in your
project directory. This file contains sensitive information, so do not share it.

2. run pip install -r requirments.txt in order to make sure you have all the required
dependencies.

3. run python3 manage.py runserver and ctrl+click on the link that pops up in the terminal
to open our app.

4. Once you see register/sign in page you're all ready to go!
